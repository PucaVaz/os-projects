# Operating Systems I Project Repository

## Overview

This repository contains two projects developed as part of the Operating Systems I coursework at the Federal University of Paraíba. Each project implements and simulates classic algorithms in computer science, focusing on page replacement and CPU scheduling.

## Projects Included

### 1. Page Replacement Algorithm Simulator

Located in the `page-replacement-simulator` directory, this project simulates three common page replacement algorithms used in operating systems:

- **FIFO (First In, First Out)**
- **OTM (Optimal Replacement)**
- **LRU (Least Recently Used)**

For detailed information about this project, please refer to its dedicated README file in the `page-replacement-simulator` directory.

### 2. CPU Scheduling Algorithms Simulator

Located in the `cpu-scheduling` directory, this project simulates three fundamental CPU scheduling algorithms:

- **FCFS (First Come, First Served)**
- **SJF (Shortest Job First)**
- **RR (Round Robin)**

For detailed information about this project, please refer to its dedicated README file in the `cpu-scheduling` directory.

## Contributing

Contributions to improve the projects are welcome. Please follow these steps:

1. Fork the repository
2. Create a new branch (`git checkout -b feature/AmazingFeature`)
3. Commit your changes (`git commit -m 'Add some AmazingFeature'`)
4. Push to the branch (`git push origin feature/AmazingFeature`)
5. Open a Pull Request

Please ensure you update the relevant project-specific README if your changes affect one of the individual projects.
